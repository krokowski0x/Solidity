# Solidity

Few projects in [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/) and JS, written for Udemy course in August 2018. Once finished, it will be further developed into some more interesting and complex stuff.

## Projects included

- **Inbox** - pretty basic Solidity Contract for storing and reading messages, with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) testing suite and compile/deploy scripts
- **Lottery** - more complex Contract, that simulates the lottery, giving a user the possibility to enter and/or pick the winner. Also tested with Mocha/Chai and with own compilation/deployment system. Additionally, it has pretty basic frontend built with [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
- **Kickstarter** - work in progress...
