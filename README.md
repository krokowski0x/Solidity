# Solidity

Few projects in [Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.4.24/) and JS, written for Udemy course in August 2018. Once finished, it will be further developed into some more interesting and complex stuff.

# Included Projects

## Inbox

Pretty basic Solidity Contract for storing and reading messages, with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Chai](http://www.chaijs.com/) testing suite and compile/deploy scripts

## Lottery

More complex Contract, that simulates the lottery, giving a user the possibility to enter and/or pick the winner. Also tested with Mocha/Chai and with own compilation/deployment system. Additionally, it has pretty basic frontend built with [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Kickstarter

Basically, smart contract-based [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) clone, with some improvements over its predecessor. Pretty serious frontend, mostly written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) lets you create, view or contribute to different campaigns, but the big difference is that to spend campaign money, manager has to create public requests, stating where and whom he wants to sent money to. And it is by voting for or against that spending by backers, that project can move along. Pretty neat stuff. Thanks [Stephen](https://github.com/StephenGrider)!
